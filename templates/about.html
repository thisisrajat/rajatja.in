Hey! I am <strong>Rajat Jain</strong>. I am an undergraduate in my junior year, majoring in computer science. I like solving algorithmic puzzles, getting caffinated at odd times of day, coding in Python and Javascript. Few years back I started participating in programming contests and I've been hooked ever since. Also, I have a thing for minimal UX. If you want to hire me or need a hand with something or just want to say hi, <a href="#contact" onclick="contact(this)">contact me</a>.
